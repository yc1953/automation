# automation
1) I have automated Testmoz - a quiz maker website.
2) By the use of Puppeteer with JavaScript I have automated the process of making quiz on this website by storing all the questions related to one topic in a JSON file and then reading those questions one-by-one. 
3) At last it generates a quiz link that can be  shared with anyone we want.
